# Calculator App
This is my rendition of "The Calculator App" project, which uses HTML, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and JavaScript to bring you a functioning calculator web app that has dark and light mode support, as well as mobile responsiveness.

I made this project mainly to practice using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) more, as I feel like it's something that I should become knowledgeable in if I want to become a major in frontend design.<br>I also used this project to experiement with the [Visual Studio Code keybinds](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf), as those are crucial to helping a developer speed up their development process.
